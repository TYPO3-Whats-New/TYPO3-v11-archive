	\small
		TYPO3 version 11.3 is the fourth sprint release on the way to the LTS-version
		(long-term support) in October 2021. This release includes a bunch of backend
		UX improvements and is now compatible with PHP version 8.0. User experience
		(UX) is about how users interact with a system or web interface.

		\vspace{0.2cm}

		In addition to PHP version 7.4, the TYPO3 Core is now also compatible
		with PHP version 8.0. Developers can leverage many new features,
		optimizations, and improvements of the programming language that powers
		TYPO3.

		\vspace{0.2cm}

		The next release on the roadmap is TYPO3 v11.4. Developers and contributors
		should be aware that this TYPO3 release (scheduled on 7 September 2021)
		will mark the \textbf{feature freeze} for the v11 cycle. Now is the best
		time to submit your code contributions to the TYPO3 Core if you want to
		see them in TYPO3 v11 LTS.
