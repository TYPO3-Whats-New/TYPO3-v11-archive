	\small
		No matter your industry, role, or what your daily tasks are.
		TYPO3 v11 LTS is the CMS for everyone.
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		Editors and integrators will be delighted with many improvements to backend usability and performance.
		TYPO3 now also ships with a secure, easy-to-use, and flexible multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution out-of-the-box.
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		We kept our promise to continuously improve the TYPO3 ecosystem and migrated more components to use well-known PSR standards in TYPO3 v11 LTS,
		which now also supports PHP v7.4 and PHP v8.0.
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		As a long-term support release (LTS), this version will be maintained by the community for at least three years.
		Extended long-term support (ELTS) will be available from the TYPO3 GmbH to add another three years of support, planning time, and peace of mind.
